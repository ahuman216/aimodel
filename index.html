Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects <b>memory, thinking skills, and the ability to perform everyday tasks,</b> impacting millions of individuals worldwide.
Over <b>7.2 million Americans aged 65 and older</b> are living with Alzheimer's diease, and costs reach about <b>384 billion</b> annually for care and treatment.
It is the most common form of dementia, accoutning for 60-80% of all dementia cases. Characterized by a slow decline in brain function, it leads to memory loss, behavioral changes, and confusion.
It is marked by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, this disrupts communication between neurons and leads to cell death. 
<br>
<h2>Symptoms:</h2>
<list>
    <li><b>Memory loss</b>: Hard to remember recent events/conversations, or even people and loved ones.</li>
    <li><b>Confusion</b>: Disorientation regarding current time and place.</li>
    <li><b>Communication</b>: Struggle to find the right words, follow conversations or express ideas.</li>
    <li><b>Emotional changes</b>: Anxiety, depression, withdrawal from everyday activities.</li>
</list>
As the disease progresses, severe memory loss causes difficulty recognizing loved ones and performing everyday tasks, making this a heartbreaking condition for all.
<br>

<h2>Causes of Symptoms:</h2>
These plaques are caused by <b>amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles</b> in the brain. Amyloid plaques are made up of amyloid precursor protein, APP, which is usually broke down by enzymes, howevever, when these processes get messed up, it causes the production of toxic beta-amyloid fragments.
When these fragments increase in volume and number, they become plaques, which accumulate between neurons in the brain, dsirupting cell communication and causing early cell death. This is extremely significant because neurons and many brain cells remain permanently in G0 after a certain point in their lives,
thus when they are damaged, they are unable to repair themselves due to being in a rest state where DNA is not being replicated and division is not being prepared for. This makes cell death especially dangerous because it cannot be recovered from,
and this is what ends up impairing brain functions. In a like manner, neurofibrillary tangles are accumulations of a protein called tau inside neurons. Usually, it is used to stabilize microtubules and assist with signal transportation, however, when tau experiences abnormal chemical changes, 
it detaches from microtubules and combines with other like proteins that form twists and tangles. These tangles disrupt the neuron's ability to transport signals, leading to dysfunction and death of the neurons. This further complicates the situation, as they start the process of brain atrophy, 
further enhancing the symptoms the individual is experiencing. While it may not seem like it, when someone has Alzheimer's diease, their brain is slowly dying, which is why it does not function normally and gets progressively worse as time goes on. This is a deadly diease that kills all, and is horrifying to experience.

<h2>Risk Factors: </h2>
The cause of Alzheimer's disease is still unknown, but with AI and other advanced technology, we are searching for it.
Factors that increase the risk of developing the disease are: 
<list>
    <li><b>Age</b>: Individuals 65+ are at higher risk</li>
    <li><b>Genetics</b>: Family history and specific genetic markers increase risk.</li>
    <li><b>Lifestyle</b>: Obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other conditions can increase risk.</li>
</list>
<br>
<h2>Diagnosis/Treatment:</h2>
To determine if someone has Alzheimer's disease, <b>medical history, cognitive tests, and brain imaging (MRIS)</b> are reviewed carefully to see if they match up with what is seen in patients with the disease.
There is <b>no set factor</b> that determines if one has it or not, making this disease more difficult to diagnose than others, as it depends on an individual's brain. This is also extremely <b>expensive</b>, as not everyone can afford MRIs or specialists.
To combat this, <b>AI can be used to evaluate various risk factors</b> and make a decision. While this is <b>not completely accurate</b>, it is an appropriate solution for many who do not have adequate access to healthcare.
<br>
In terms of treatment, there is currently <b>no cure</b>, however, treatments can <b>manage symptoms and increase quality of life</b>, including supportive care and medication.
However, there is hope that in the future, a cure is found, one that <b>regenerates the dead neurons</b>, allowing the brain to regain functionality.

<br>
By using AI, as I have done in this project, it is possible to catch <b>earlier signs</b> of Alzheimer's diease before it reaches a point where the symptoms are irreversible.
I have trained an AI model to identify various stages and presence of the disease <b>(mildly demented, moderately demented, very mildly demented and non demented)</b> based on png images from mri scans.
Technology such as this, along with other AI-powered tech, has the power to change many lives as it increases early detection for many diseases. 
In the case of <b>genetics and pharmaceuticals</b>, it is much faster, easier and more convenient to create new medicines, gene combinations and other life changing technology, which would take extremely large amounts of resources and time to do by hand.
Try this model today by uploading a <b>PNG</b> image of a brain MRI scan. If you do not have one lying around, you can easily find one online! 
Just search up <b>"Alzheimer's brain MRI image"</b> (If you want one with Alzheimer's), and <b>"Brain MRI image"</b> (If you want one without). <b>Try out both, and see how they compare! Can you find the differences that the AI might have picked up on?</b>
